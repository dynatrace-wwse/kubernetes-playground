# Script for installing Keptn in an Ubuntu Server LTS     #
# (20 or 18). Installed components are but not limited to:#
# Microk8s, Keptn, Istio, Helm, Docker, Docker Registry   #
# Jenkins, Dynatrace OneAgent, Dynatrace ActiveGate,      #

# This file is the main installation process. In here you #
# define the installationBundles and its functions.       #
# The definition of variables and different versions are  #
# defined here.                                           #
#                                                         #
# 'functions.sh' is where the functions are defined and   #
# will be loaded into this shell upon execution.          #
# controlled via boolean flags.                           #
#                                                         #
# An installationBundle contains a set of multiple ins-   #
# tallation functions.                                    #
# Recommend to run the script like this:                  #
#      sudo bash -c './k8s-install.sh &'               #
